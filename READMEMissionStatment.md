Mission Statement

	MyTrip is a social media website for people planning trips. MyTrip trips are travel plans that groups of people will be attending together.
  MyTrip allows users to create a profile and host information about trips they are planning. MyTrip users grant access to the planning system 
  that will allow other users attending the same planned trip to view and update that trip data and provide feedback during the planning process. 
  MyTrip will allow people to collaborate on trips that will streamline the communication process for group trip planning.
